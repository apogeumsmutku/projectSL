# projectSL
A simple TODO app.
There is room for improvement.

How to use:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Delete the /venv folder.
3. Open your terminal and select the correct filepath. (for example C:\projectSL)
4. Type in "python -m venv --upgrade-deps venv" and press Enter to create a new library root.
5. Type in ".\venv\Scripts\activate" and press Enter to activate the required scripts. (Might need to enable script files in Windows PowerShell).
6. Install the required modules and libraries by typing in "pip install -r requirements.txt" and pressing Enter.
7. Once everything is set up you can open the app by typing "python app.py" in your terminal and pressing Enter.
8. The IDE should generate a website link, once you paste in into a browser, everything should work just fine.

Currently the app is intended for Polish users, thus some file names are in Polish. (for clarification praca - work, zgloszenie - application, registration)
